# RhombixTechnologies_Tasks_3
This repository contains the tasks completed during my internship at Rhombix Technologies
One of the key tasks I completed was RFID Blocking, which focuses on preventing unauthorized scanning of sensitive data from credit/debit cards, passports, and other documents with RFID tags. This project aims to block RFID signals to ensure data security during contactless payments.
